This section will explore common methods for adapting base models:

- Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
- LoRA / QLoRA for low-resource training
- Frameworks: HuggingFace Transformers, DeepSpeed, FSDP
- Adapter tuning vs. full-parameter tuning

🔗 Future addition: sample LoRA config + training CLI snippet
