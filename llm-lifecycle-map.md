# 🧠 From Model to Product: LLM Lifecycle Map

A concise overview of the key phases involved in turning a large language model (LLM) into a production-ready product.

This cheatsheet reflects real-world workflows from my experience working with enterprise-grade LLMs, model optimization at Deci.ai, and productization in GenAI environments.

---

## 📥 1. Data Preparation

- Dataset curation (clean, balanced, diverse)
- Deduplication / pre-filtering
- Synthetic data generation (e.g., self-instruct)
- Tokenization strategy (sentencepiece, BPE)
- Dataset formats (JSONL, Parquet)

---

## ⚙️ 2. Model Training & Fine-tuning

- Base model selection (e.g., Mistral, LLaMA, Falcon, GPT-NeoX)
- Fine-tuning methods:
  - SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)
  - LoRA / QLoRA for efficient adaptation
- Frameworks: HuggingFace Transformers, DeepSpeed, FSDP
- Logging & versioning (Weights & Biases, MLflow)

---

## 🧪 3. Evaluation & Feedback

- Benchmarks (MMLU, HELM, ARC, TruthfulQA)
- Prompt-based eval (manual + GPT-assisted)
- Auto-grading (factuality, coherence, tone)
- Human preference scoring (Elo, pairwise)
- Dataset: MT-Bench, OpenOrca, ShareGPT, AlpacaEval

---

## 🚀 4. Deployment & Optimization

- Model compression: quantization (INT8, FP4)
- LoRA adapter merging for runtime use
- Latency optimization (ONNX, Triton Inference Server)
- Multi-GPU or edge serving (Ray Serve, vLLM, TensorRT-LLM)
- API productization: auth, rate-limiting, logging

---

## 🔒 5. Safety, Ethics & Alignment

- Red-teaming & jailbreak testing
- Output filtering (moderation models, regex, classifiers)
- Constitutional AI principles (Anthropic-style)
- Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
- Transparency: explainability and user controls

---

## 🧩 Suggested Use

- Use this map to assess your LLM stack readiness
- Identify bottlenecks in pipeline (e.g., eval or latency)
- Adapt sections based on open-source or proprietary stack
